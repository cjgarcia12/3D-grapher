# 3D Grapher

## Overview

The 3D Grapher project is a Python-based application designed to visualize 3D mathematical functions and data. This project was created to learn and practice basic Python libraries, including Plotly, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It provides an interactive platform to explore complex 3D graphs and understand the underlying mathematical concepts.

## Features

- **3D Plotting:** Utilizes Plotly to create interactive 3D plots that can be rotated, zoomed, and explored in detail.
- **Mathematical Functions:** Supports visualization of various mathematical functions and equations in three dimensions.
- **User Interface:** Includes a simple and intuitive interface for inputting functions and adjusting plot parameters.

## Learning Objectives

- **Python Programming:** Gained a deeper understanding of Python programming and its application in data visualization.
- **Plotly Library:** Learned to use Plotly for creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
- **NumPy and Matplotlib:** Applied NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for additional plotting capabilities.
- **3D Visualization:** Developed skills in visualizing complex data and mathematical functions in three dimensions.
